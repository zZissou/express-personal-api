## Goal

Build a personal API that will incorporate JSON API Endpoints, REST-ful Routes, and CRUD. My topic of choice is 90s Nickelodeon shows. For future versions, I will expand to include 90s Cartoon Network shows and the timeless 90s Disney movies... Always a classic.

I would also like to add more data to each show. Perhaps include main characters, number of seasons, and imdb rating.
